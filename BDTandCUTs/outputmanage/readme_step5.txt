I have some numbers I want you transfer it to some format that easy for me to put it in excel. I'll provide you  an example on how to do it.

my input:
Hscore = 0.5 Wscore = 0.5 Mlb = 200
0.00295949   0.135885
2.63403   0.179505
2.62626  0.307527
3.97974  0.0579092
your output:
H=0.5,W=0.5,Mlb=200, 0.00295949+-0.135885, 2.63403+-0.179505, 2.62626+-0.307527, 3.97974 +-0.0579092
